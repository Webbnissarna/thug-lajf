# Thug lajf

A simple game made with [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php).

As of 2023-01-29 it is far from finished.

## Getting it started

**Disclaimer**: I use visual studio and everything should be configured in the visual studio meta files.

If you are a wizard with MAKE files or CMake etc, go ahead and please make a pull request with information regarding how it works. Would love to use VSC instead of VS for C++ development :D 

Unzip the sfml zip and move the `include` and `lib` folders to a folder `deps` in the root.
